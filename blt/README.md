# Byte Latent Transformer

This repository contains code for our paper: "Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens"

- [Paper Link](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/blt/BLT__Patches_Scale_Better_Than_Tokens.pdf)

## Abstract

We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer architecture (BLTs), a new byte-level LLM architecture that
for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale, with significant improvements
in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve
as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented dynamically based on the entropy of the
next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where there is more data complexity. The BLT
architecture includes new attention mechanisms to maximize the information flow between byte and
patch hidden representations and a new type of byte-sequence memory. We present the first scaling
study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 8T training bytes, showing for the first time
that we can train a model end-to-end at scale from bytes with no tokenization or other preprocessing.
Scaling trends reveal training and inference efficiency benefits from dynamically selecting very long
patches on average, along with qualitative improvements with reasoning and long tail generalization
from modeling byte-sequences.

## Development Status

We are actively updating the blt code to make it easier to reproduce our results.
Please file an issue and/or be patient while we make more of our code public!

## Quick start

There are three ways you can create your environment.

### Option 1: conda + pip

Run these commands in your terminal or a script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/blt
cd blt
conda create -n blt python=3.12
conda activate blt
pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121
pip install ninja
pip install -v -U git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers.git@de742ec3d64bd83b1184cc043e541f15d270c148
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate blt
```

### Option 2: Slurm Job to Build Env

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/blt
cd blt

bash setup/create_env.sh
# or if you have access to a SLURM cluster
sbatch setup/create_env.sh
```

Once that is done you can activate the environment

```bash
conda activate blt_<date>
```

### Options 3 (experimental, reproducible): uv

Run the following to install the env using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
The main benefit of this method is that the build is reproducible since there is a lock file.

```bash
uv pip install --group pre_build --no-build-isolation
uv pip install --group compile_xformers --no-build-isolation
uv sync
uv run python download_blt_weights.py
uv run python demo.py "A BLT has"
```

## Downloading HF Model Weights and Generating Text

We have released weights on HF for the [BLT 1B Model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blt-1b) and [BLT 7B Model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blt-7b).
We are actively working with HF to make BLT available in [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) and will update this when it is.
In the meantime, you can follow these instructions to load model weights, initialize a model, and generate text.
These instructions have been tested on H100 GPUs, but we can only offer suggestions on running on other hardware.

1. On the model weights HF page, create a HuggingFace account, request access to weights, and wait for approval.
2. On the huggingface cli, login: `huggingface-cli login`

From here there are two options: (1) load weights in our train script and (2) loading weights via HF hub to use for anything else.

## Load Weights via HF Hub

In your terminal:

```bash
python -m bytelatent.hf load-transformers --entropy-repo facebook/blt-entropy --blt-repo facebook/blt-1b --prompt "My test prompt" hub
```

In your own code:

```python
from bytelatent.transformer import LMTransformer
from bytelatent.model.blt import ByteLatentTransformer
from bytelatent.hf import BltTokenizerAndPatcher

entropy_repo = "facebook/blt-entropy"
blt_repo = "facebook/blt-1b"
entropy_model = LMTransformer.from_pretrained(entropy_repo)
blt_model = ByteLatentTransformer.from_pretrained(blt_repo)
tok_and_patcher = BltTokenizerAndPatcher.from_pretrained(blt_repo)
tokenizer = tok_and_patcher.tokenizer_args.build()
patcher = tok_and_patcher.patcher_args.build()
```

## Load Weights for Running BLT Train Script

1. Download the model weights with: `python download_blt_weights.py`, which will load to `hf-weights`
2. Run the generate demo: `python demo.py "A BLT has"`.

The demo generates text, but is also a good starting point for loading BLT in your own code.

## Downloading Training Data

Note: The following instructions are not well tested in the BLT code as it is based on the lingua code, which we have diverged from.

Use the provided script to download and prepare data from huggingface (among `fineweb_edu`, `fineweb_edu_10bt`, or `dclm_baseline_1.0`).
This command will download the `fineweb_edu` and prepare it for training in the `./data` directory, specifying the amount of memory `terashuf` (the tool used to shuffle samples) will be allocated. By default, the number of chunks (`nchunks`) is 32. If you are running on fewer than 32 GPUs, it is recommended to set `nchunks` to 1 or to match `nchunks` with the number of GPUs (`nchunks` = NGPUs). See [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/lingua/issues/55#issuecomment-2483643076) for more details.

```bash
python setup/download_prepare_hf_data.py fineweb_edu <MEMORY> --data_dir ./data --seed 42 --nchunks <NCHUNKS>
```

to download tokenizer (here llama3), use the following script:

```bash
python setup/download_tokenizer.py llama3 <SAVE_PATH> --api_key <HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>
```

Now launch a debug job to check if everything works. **The provided configurations are templates, you need to adapt them for them to work (change `dump_dir`, `data.root_dir`, `data.tokenizer.path`, etc ...)**

```bash
# stool stands for SLURM tool !
python -m bytelatent.stool script=bytelatent.train config=bytelatent/configs/debug.yaml nodes=1 partition=<partition>
# if you want to launch locally you can use torchrun
torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 -m bytelatent.train config=bytelatent/configs/debug.yaml
# or you can also launch on 1 GPU
python -m bytelatent.train  config=bytelatent/configs/debug.yaml
```

When using `stool`, if a job crashes, it can be relaunched using sbatch:

```bash
sbatch path/to/dump_dir/submit.slurm
```

## Linting

To lint, run the following command

```
bash dev/lint.sh
```
